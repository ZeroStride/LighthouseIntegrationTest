This repository is for testing our bugfix workflow integration with Lighthouse.

The 'repush' script first resets the local repository to the first commit, then force-pushes the repository to the origin. It then uses the functionality of the git reflog to easily return to the previous state of HEAD in the local repository, and force-pushes the repository to the origin. This allows for simple, consistent testing of the Lighthouse-workflow post-receive server.
