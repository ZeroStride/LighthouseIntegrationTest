This repository is for testing our bugfix workflow integration with Lighthouse.

The 'repush' script first resets the local repository to the first commit, then force-pushes the repository to the origin. It then uses the functionality of the git reflog to easily return to the previous state of HEAD in the local repository, and force-pushes the repository to the origin. This allows for simple, consistent testing of the Lighthouse-workflow post-receive server.

This repository is wired in to this (public) Lighthouse project: http://gameclay.lighthouseapp.com/projects/47141-workflow-test/

This repository contains bugs which will be automatically re-initialized by the commits in the 'repush'.
